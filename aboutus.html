        <div class="main">
        <h4 id="fourth">4.<b>Payment</b></h4>
        <p>You understand that use of the Services may result in charges to you
        for the services or goods you receive from a Third Party Provider
        (“Charges”). After you have received services or goods obtained through 
        our use of the Service, Eelspace will facilitate your payment of the
        applicable Charges on behalf of the Third Party Provider as such Third
        Party Provider’s limited payment collection agent. Payment of the 
        Charges in such manner shall be considered the same as payment made
        directly by you to the Third Party Provider. Charges may include other
        applicable fees, tolls, and/or surcharges including a booking fee, 
        national, provincial and municipal tolls, airport surcharges and
        processing fees for split payments, and will be inclusive of applicable
        taxes where required by law. Charges paid by you are final and 
        non-refundable, unless otherwise determined by Eelspace. You retain
        the right to request lower Charges from a Third Party Provider for 
        services or goods received by you from such Third Party Provider at
        the time you receive such services or goods. Eelspace will respond 
        accordingly to any request from a Third Party Provider to modify the
        Charges for a particular service or good.
        All Charges are due immediately and payment will be facilitated by
        Eelspace using the preferred payment method designated in your Account,
        after which Eelspace will send you a receipt by email. If your primary
        Account payment method is determined to be expired, invalid or otherwise 
        not able to be charged, you agree that Eelspace may, as the Third 
        PartyProvider’s limited payment collection agent, use a secondary payment
        method in your Account, if available. As between you and Eelspace, 
        Eelspace reserves the right to establish, remove and/or revise Charges
        for any or all services or goods obtained through the use of the 
        Services at any time in Eelspace’s sole discretion. Further, you 
        acknowledge and agree that Charges applicable in certain geographical
        areas may increase substantially during times of high demand. Eelspace
        will use reasonable efforts to inform you of Charges that may apply, 
        provided that you will be responsible for Charges incurred under your
        Account regardless of your awareness of such Charges or the amounts
        thereof. Eelspace may from time to time provide certain users with
        promotional offers and discounts that may result in different amounts 
        charged for the same or similar services or goods obtained through the
        use of the Services, and you agree that such promotional offers and 
        discounts, unless also made available to you, shall have no bearing on
        your use of the Services or the Charges applied to you. You may elect 
        to cancel your request for services or goods from a Third Party Provider
        at any time prior to such Third Party Provider’s arrival, in which case
        you may be charged a cancellation fee. You shall be responsible for the
        cost of repair for damage to your facility, and property resulting from
        use of the Services under your Account in excess of normal
        “wear and tear” damages and necessary cleaning (“Repair or Cleaning”).
